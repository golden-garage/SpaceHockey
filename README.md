# SpaceHockey Tutorial

## What is SpaceHockey?

A simple two player app for touch screens.

It is built using [Qt](http://www.qt.io/) with additional Gaming Components from [V-Play](http://v-play.net/).

[Qt](http://www.qt.io/) is the leading independent technology for cross-platform development. [Qt Quick]() provides a
declarative language called QML (Qt Meta-object Language) for the design and implementation of UIs. QML is based on CSS
and JavaScript. Large parts of QML code are just CSS-style name-value pairs of properties (e.g., color: "red"). The
rest, typically the behavioral parts like the response to a mouse click, is written in JavaScript.

[V-Play](http://v-play.net/) Gaming Components provide a specialized set of QML components for building 2D games on top
of Qt 5 for multiple platforms, with the same source code. Components exist for handling multiple display resolutions &
aspect ratios, Sprites, Physics, Particles, Multimedia, Multitouch Input and AI.

The current version of the game is a simple simulation of air hockey in a space-like environment.
